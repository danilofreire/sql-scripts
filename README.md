# Git Your SQL Together!

This repository contains my personal SQL scripts. I'm a real beginner, so while
my scripts are probably too simple for others to use, I thought it would be
nice to have them in one place. I ~~stole~~ borrowed the idea (and the title)
from a great [blog post by Caitlin
Hudon](https://caitlinhudon.com/2018/11/28/git-sql-together/), which states
three SQL Truths:

> * You will *always* need that query again 
> * Queries are living artifacts that change over time 
> * If it's useful to you, it's useful to others (and vice versa)

I think she's absolutely right. Since I've been using git for quite some time,
why not keep a repository with all my SQL code? It will save me precious time
in the future (point #1), I can track all script changes (point #2), and if you
like anything you see here, please go ahead and use it too. Again, if you
already know SQL there isn't much for you to see here, but maybe my code can
help a fellow beginner. Comments and suggestions are always very welcome!
